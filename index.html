            <p class="lead">Version Control System is a way to efficiently record and save data. It serves as a useful way for users to manage and backup their work, no matter what they're using it to store. Version Control Systems (VCS) also find themselves being tremendously useful when it comes to managing the storage of files when it comes to user collaborations. Not only can it aid in keeping track of the different versions of a file, but it can also allow for multiple users to work on the same file and handle the eventual merge. In certain VCSs, filesystems can be cloned and pulled for individual use, and then completely merged and updated to the original existing filesystem. This is important, especially for developers and coders, who are usually in need of sharing and modifying pieces of code with others. Just as well, in the educational community, in which resources need to be distributed, VCS can be useful in allowing a creator to share their content or work with the public in a way that won't harmfully effect their work. The possibilities of what a VCS can do are almost endless, making it a unique and very powerful tool for anyone in the business of storing data.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are different types of version control systems, including the <b>C</b>entralized <b>V</b>ersion <b>C</b>ontrol <b>S</b>ystems as well as <b>D</b>istributed <b>V</b>ersion <b>C</b>ontrol <b>S</b>ystems. Now I used the title, CVCS <em><b>vs.</b></em> DVCS, however there really is not competition. Perhaps it just might come down to a difference in intended use, but DCVS is really more like the next step of what a CVCS is supposed to be. A centralized version control system is basically a version control system in which the main copy of a project or file system is stored in one place, usually on a server. When a user needs to access a file or make changes, they can do so and commit them to the main copy. On the other hand, DVCSs are similar to CVCSs, except that <em>all</em> users with access to the project will have a complete clone of the filesystem on their local repository. Because of this, users can work offline, work with files much faster, and make changes all at once rather than one at a time. So it seems, DCVS is the way to go. Popular CVCSs include SVN and CVS, and popular DCVSs are <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> and Mercurial.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">What is Git?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a free and open-source version control system created in 2005, filling in the void after BitKeeper and Linux's relationship "broke down". Now, Git is perhaps one of the most popular VCSs available and maintains being on of the fastest and most powerful tools out there for storing and managing data. Because it makes use of a "branching" model of structure, the user is afforded many opportunities when it comes to making changes in collaboration projects. Branches are able to be modified, merged, cloned, you name it! And the changes made can be kept on your own master branch, or your own local repository without worry, allowing for all types of experimentation. Git is also distributed version control system, which means that clones of the master branch exists on multiple machines. As I've mentioned earlier, this holds several key advantages, including perhaps the most important of all: multiple backups. Since staring data is one of the main reasons for using such a program, multiple backups is a huge plus. The steps in which a file moves in git on goes like this: <ul><li>working directory</li><li>staging area</li><li>repository</li></ul> The staging area is unique to Git and holds it's own advantages when it comes to uploading parts of projects. I'll explain more about the commands to get it there in the next topic.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is currently one of the most popular version control systems currently out there, and is easily accessible via the terminal. Because it can be enabled through the terminal, it may be utilized using the command line. Often, as with most programs that use the command line, learning all the different commands can be quite daunting. Fortunately, however, git shares quite a few of the basic common commands, including <code>mv</code>, <code>rm</code>, <code>diff</code>, and even <code>grep</code>. The most important ones that someone who's starting up will need to know, and will probably be using most, are: <ul><li><code>git init</code> creates a local repository where you can store your data under a VCS (Git)</li><li><code>git add [filename(s)]</code> adds modified files to the staging area where they await being fully committed to the local repository</li><li><code>git commit</code> places objects from the staging area into the local repository</li><li><code>git status</code> displays the status of your files in the staging area and working directory</li></ul> Of course, there are many other commands to be used, and the can be found in the Git website's documentation list <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs">here</a>.</p>

            <p class="lead">GitHub is a website that hosts a remote repository for users using a distributed control system. Github is extremely helpful for developers and the like in order to distribute their codes and give access to those who might want to contribute. Anyways, here's how to get started. First, you must visit the page, <a href="https://github.com">www.github.com</a>. Next, the steps are as follows: <ol><li>Click the Sign Up button at the upper right hand corner and fill in your username, e-mail, and password.</li><li>Make sure the <em>free</em> option is checked when asked</li><li><em>Voilà! You're Done! just hit the finish sign up button below.</em></li></ol> So creating an account was easy. In the next part, you'll have to link your new remote repository (GitHub) to your local repository. <ol><li>You'll do that by logging in (if you aren't already) and clicking the the plus symbol (<b>+</b>) at the upper right hand corner and clicking the option: <b>New repository</b>. Fill in a name, leave the rest untouched and click <b>Create Repository</b> at the bottom of the screen.</li> <li>On the next page, you'll be given several options. Scroll down to the option, "…or push an existing repository from the command line" and copy the code to your clipboard. The code should look something like this: <code>git remote add origin git@github.com:nmc14b/example.git<br>
git push -u origin master<br></code>.</li> <li>Paste the link in the terminal of your local repository and you're good to go!</li></ol> And that's how to create a GitHub account and link it to your local repository.</p>
